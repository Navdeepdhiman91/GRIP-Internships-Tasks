**Task 2:**
Linear Regression with Python Scikit Learn
In this section we will see how the Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning can be used to implement regression functions. We will start with simple linear regression involving two variables.
 
***Simple Linear Regression***
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.

We can download the **dataset** from here: http://bit.ly/w-
Now it's time to find out what would be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hours in a day?
